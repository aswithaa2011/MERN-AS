// 1. What is JavaScript?
// JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language mainly used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.
// It can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
// It can update and change both HTML and CSS.
// It is the only programming language supported by all browsers
// Used for frontend, backend, mobile apps, and desktop apps

// 2. What are variables?
// Variables are named references that point to values stored in memory.
// JavaScript variables are containers for data.

// JavaScript variables can be declared in 4 ways:

// Modern JavaScript         
// Using let
// Using const

// Older JavaScript
// Using var (Not Recommended)
// Automatically (Not Recommended)

// 3. Difference between var, let, const?

// Var
// Function-scoped (not block-scoped)
// Can be re-declared
// Can be re-assigned
// Hoisted and initialized with undefined
// Can cause bugs, so not recommended


//  Let
// Block-scoped {}
// Cannot be re-declared in same scope
// Can be re-assigned
// Hoisted but not initialized 
// Preferred over var

// const
// Block-scoped
// Cannot be re-declared
// Cannot be re-assigned
// Hoisted but not initialized 
// Must be initialized at declaration
// Best practice by default


// 4. What is datatype?
// Data types define the kind of value stored in a variable.
// JavaScript uses types to determine how a value behaves and what operations can be performed on it.

// Determines storage & operations
// Helps prevent errors
// Two categories: Primitive & Reference

// 5.Types of primitive datatypes?
// JavaScript has 7 primitive data types:
// Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, and Symbol.


// 6.What are non-primitive datatypes?
// Non-primitive data types (also called reference types) are data types that can store multiple values or complex structures.

// They are:
// Mutable (can be changed)
// Stored by reference (memory address)

// In JavaScript, the main non-primitive types are:
// Object
// Array
// Function

// 7.What Are Operators?
// Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on values (operands).

// 8.Types of operators?

// Arithmetic  + - * / %
// Assignment = += -=
// Comparison == === > <
// Logical  && || !
// Unary  ++ -- typeof
// Ternary ?:
// Bitwise  & | ^
// Type typeof instanceof

// 9.What is expression?
// An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that produces a value.
//  Every expression returns a value.
 
//  x + 5


//  10.What is statement?
// A statement is a complete instruction that tells JavaScript to perform an action.
// Statements do not necessarily return a value.

// let x = 10;

// 11.What is control statement?

// A control statement is a statement that controls the flow of execution in a program.

// It decides:
// Which code runs
// How many times it runs
// When to stop running


// Type	            Example
// Conditional	        if, if else, else if, switch
// Looping	            for, while , do while
// Jump	            break, continue, return

// 12. What are conditional statements?
// Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.
// they execute certain code only if a condition is true.

// Conditional	statements  :   if, if else, else if, switch

// 13. What are looping statements?
// Looping statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition is true.

// Looping	statements     :   for, while , do while

// 14. What is hoisting?
// Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before execution.
// Only declarations are hoisted, Initializations are NOT hoisted.

// 15. what is scope?
// Scope determines where a variable or function can be accessed or used in a program.

// Global Scope
// A variable declared outside any function or block has global scope.

// Function Scope
// A variable declared inside a function is accessible only inside that function.

// Block Scope
// A variable declared inside { } using let or const.

// 16. What is closure?
// A closure is created when a function remembers and can access variables from its outer (parent) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
// A closure is a function that “remembers” its parent’s variables.
